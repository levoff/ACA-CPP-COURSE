# What is C++

C++ is a [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

[C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.cplusplus.com/info/history/), as an extension to the [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language).

Unlike many other languages like JavaScrypt, Python, Java, etc., [C++ is a compiled language](https://www.cplusplus.com/info/description/) and gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.



# Why Use C++

C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ is used to write the most high performace and popular softwares like:
- Operations systems: Windows, Macos
- Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox
- Database software: MySQL
- A lot of Games
- ...

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.












# C++ Get Started

To start using C++, you need two things:

A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
A compiler, like GCC (MinGW for windows [www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org) ), to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand.
There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). This is very fast and lighweight code editor that can be configured as an IDE(instead of VS Code for instance)..

!!! Note
    If you have problems installing the code/text editor and/or compiler, you can use one of online C++ code compilers, like [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)

## C++ Install IDE/Code editor and compiler

### For ***Windows*** operation system
0. Download [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) and install it as a code editor. 
1. Download [MinGW](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2022-01-18/msys2-x86_64-20220118.exe) and install this [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler). 
2. Open MSYS2 program from Windows start menu and paste this and then hit enter: `pacman -Syu`.
3. After the first command is executed, paste this command in the MSYS2: `pacman -Su`
4. And the last one: `pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`
5. This should be added to the PATH environment variables: `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`

### For ***Mac OS*** operation system

Just download the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) and install it as a code editor. 
The Mac OS already has installed a C++ compiler.











# C++ First program

Let's write our first program. Copy the code above and paste in a new document inside the Sublime Text and save it with name "first.cpp".

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
This code is just a text and the Sublime does nothing but highlithing the syntax of C++ code/text for developer. 

!!! WARNING
    It is important to save the C++ code file with extension ".cpp"

!!! WARNING
    It is important to save the C++ code before compilation.

!!! Note
    1.`Compile the code` : Ctr+Shift+B -> select <mark>C++ single file</mark>  OR type in terminal <mark>g++ first.cpp -o first</mark>  . The compiler will generate an executable programm with name "first".
    
    2.`Run the program`: Double click on the executable in your file browser but **Not In Sublime Text**. Our first program prints a mesage "Hello World!" in the terminal. That is what we have programmed in the code.


!!! WARNING
    Don't worry if you don't understand how <mark>#include <\iostream></mark> and <mark>using namespace std</mark> works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.
!!! WARNING
    Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;
!!! WARNING
    Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;


## C++ Comments
Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).
```C
// This is a comment
cout << "Hello World!";
```

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:
```C
cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`. Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler:
```C
/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
cout << "Hello World!";
```

Let's modify our first program's code and add some comments into it.

```cpp
/*The line below is called "including a header file". We need this to be able to print a message.*/
#include <iostream> 

using namespace std; // We need this also for printing messages and output other things into terminal with "cout".


// This called a function whcih name is "main" and the type is int. 
// When we compile and execute our code, the programm always starts from this function.
// Any C++ programm MUST have this function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
int main() {
  
  cout << "Hello World!"; // Here we print a message to the terminal.
  
  return 0; // Here we return a 0 to the Operation System, when the execution of our program is completed.
}
```

!!! Note
    Let's save the file and again compile and execute. We can notice that the program does exactly the same thing as before. 
    That is because we have only added comments into our code and the compiler ignores them.


















# C++ Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different <mark>types</mark> of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- `float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- `double` - like float but with higher(double) precision
- `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- `string` - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- `bool` - stores values with two states: true or false

!!! Note: float vs. double
    The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

Declaring (Creating) Variables
!!! Note: To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:
    *`type variableName = value;`*

Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:
```C
//Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:
int myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;
```

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:
```C
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;
```

Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
```C
int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10
```

A demonstration of other data types:
```C
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)
```

## Declare Many Variables
To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:
```C
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
```
## One Value to Multiple Variables
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
```C
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
```

## C++ Identifiers
All C++ variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:
```C
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;
```
!!! WARNING: The general rules for naming variables are:
    - Names can contain letters, digits and underscores ONLY
    - Names must begin with a letter or an underscore _
    - Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
    - Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
    - Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names


# C++ Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
```C
int x = 100 + 50;
```

Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:
```C
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
```

C++ divides the operators into the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators 
- Logical operators 
- Bitwise operators


Operator  | Type       | Name                     | Description                            | Example             | Same As

!!! Note: Bitwise operators
    C++ also provides bitwise operators which are not represented here in the table. In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits. They can only be used alongside char and int data types.

### Example 1: operators.cpp
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {


    int a, b;
    int result_a, result_b;
    bool result;

    a = 7; // 7 is assigned to a
    b = 2; // 2 is assigned to b


    // ARITHEMETIC OPERATORS
    cout << "a + b = " << (a + b) << endl; // printing the sum of a and b
    
    cout << "a - b = " << (a - b) << endl; // printing the difference of a and b

    cout << "a * b = " << (a * b) << endl; // printing the product of a and b
    
    cout << "a / b = " << (a / b) << endl; // printing the division of a by b

    cout << "a % b = " << (a % b) << endl; // printing the modulo of a by b

    result_a = ++a; // incrementing a by 1 and storing the result in result_a
    cout << "result_a = " << result_a << endl;

    result_b = --b; // decrementing b by 1 and storing the result in result_b  
    cout << "result_b = " << result_b << endl;
    cout <<"a = " << a <<" b = " << b << endl;

    // COMPARISON OPERATORS
    a = 7; // 7 is assigned to a again
    b = 2; // 2 is assigned to b again

    result = (a == b);   // false
    cout << "7 == 2 is " << result << endl;

    result = (a != b);  // true
    cout << "7 != 2 is " << result << endl;

    result = a > b;   // true
    cout << "7 > 2 is " << result << endl;

    result = a < b;   // false
    cout << "7 < 2 is " << result << endl;

    result = a >= b;  // true
    cout << "7 >= 2 is " << result << endl;

    result = a <= b;  // false
    cout << "7 <= 2 is " << result << endl;



    // LOGICAL OPERATORS

    result = (3 != 5) && (3 < 5);     // true
    cout << "(3 != 5) && (3 < 5) is " << result << endl;

    result = (3 == 5) && (3 < 5);    // false
    cout << "(3 == 5) && (3 < 5) is " << result << endl;

    result = (3 == 5) && (3 > 5);    // false
    cout << "(3 == 5) && (3 > 5) is " << result << endl;

    result = (3 != 5) || (3 < 5);    // true
    cout << "(3 != 5) || (3 < 5) is " << result << endl;

    result = (3 != 5) || (3 > 5);    // true
    cout << "(3 != 5) || (3 > 5) is " << result << endl;

    result = (3 == 5) || (3 > 5);    // false
    cout << "(3 == 5) || (3 > 5) is " << result << endl;

    result = !(5 == 2);    // true
    cout << "!(5 == 2) is " << result << endl;

    result = !(5 == 5);    // false
    cout << "!(5 == 5) is " << result << endl;


    return 0;
}
```

!!! Note
    Paste this code into a new file with name "operators.cpp" -> Build(compile) and Run the Example 1

*Output should be:*
```
a + b = 9
a - b = 5
a * b = 14
a / b = 3
a % b = 1
result_a = 8
result_b = 1
a = 8 b = 1
7 == 2 is 0
7 != 2 is 1
7 > 2 is 1
7 < 2 is 0
7 >= 2 is 1
7 <= 2 is 0
(3 != 5) && (3 < 5) is 1
(3 == 5) && (3 < 5) is 0
(3 == 5) && (3 > 5) is 0
(3 != 5) || (3 < 5) is 1
(3 != 5) || (3 > 5) is 1
(3 == 5) || (3 > 5) is 0
!(5 == 2) is 1
!(5 == 5) is 0

```



!!! WARNING: Increment, Decrement
    In the above program, we have used the ++ and -- operators as prefixes (++a and --b). However, we can also use these operators as postfix (a++ and b--).


!!! WARNING: / Division operator and int types (integral types)
    As we can see from the above example, if an integer is divided by another integer, we will get the quotient. However, if either divisor or dividend is a floating-point number, we will get the result in decimals.
    ```
    In C++,

    7/2 is 3
    7.0 / 2 is 3.5
    7 / 2.0 is 3.5
    7.0 / 2.0 is 3.5
    ```

!!! WARNING: % Modulo Operator
    The modulo operator % computes the remainder. When a = 9 is divided by b = 4, the remainder is 1.

    The % operator can only be used with integers.


## Ternary operator

A ternary operator evaluates the test condition and executes a block of code based on the result of the condition.

```C
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

Here, condition is evaluated and

- if condition is true, expression1 is executed.
- And, if condition is false, expression2 is executed.

The ternary operator takes 3 operands (condition, expression1 and expression2). Hence, the name ternary operator.



# C++ Flow Control

A simple C++ statement is each of the individual instructions of a program, like the variable declarations and expressions seen in previous sections. They always end with a semicolon (;), and are executed in the same order in which they appear in a program.

But programs are not limited to a linear sequence of statements. During its process, a program may repeat segments of code, or take decisions and bifurcate. For that purpose, C++ provides flow control statements that serve to specify what has to be done by our program, when, and under which circumstances.


- Conditional and/or branching statements: `if...else, switch`
- Loops: `for, while, do...while`
- Jump statements: `break, continue, goto`

## If...Else statement
![How if...else Statement Works](./A/if_else.png)

[geeksforgeeks.org/c-c-if-else-statement-with-examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-c-if-else-statement-with-examples/)



## For loop

The general syntax: 
```C
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body of-loop 
}
```
Here,

- initialization - initializes variables and is executed only once
- condition - if true, the body of for loop is executed if false, the for loop is terminated
- update - updates the value of initialized variables and again checks the condition

**Example**

```C
// C++ Program to print numbers from 1 to 5
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
        cout << "i=" << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
*Output should be:*
```
i=1 i=2 i=3 i=4 i=5 
```



## While loop

The general syntax:

```C
while (condition) {
    // body of the loop
}
```

Here,

- A while loop evaluates the condition
- If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the while loop is executed.
- The condition is evaluated again.
- This process continues until the condition is false.
- When the condition evaluates to false, the loop terminates.

**Example**

```C
// C++ Program to print numbers from 1 to 5

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 1; 

    // while loop from 1 to 5
    while (i <= 5) {
        cout << "i=" << i << " ";
        ++i;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

*Output should be:*
```
i=1 i=2 i=3 i=4 i=5 
```



!!! Note: *for* VS *while* loops
    A for loop is usually used when the number of iterations is known.

    However, while and do...while loops are usually used when the number of iterations is unknown.


## Break and Continue statements

- In C++, the break statement terminates the loop when it is encountered.
- In C++, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and the control of the program goes to the next iteration.

![How Break and Continue Statement Works](./A/break_continue.png)


## Switch statement

The switch statement allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives.

The general syntax:

```C
switch (expression)  {
    case constant1:
        // code to be executed if 
        // expression is equal to constant1;
        break;

    case constant2:
        // code to be executed if
        // expression is equal to constant2;
        break;
        .
        .
        .
    default:
        // code to be executed if
        // expression doesn't match any constant
}
```

!!! Note
    We can do the same thing with the if...else..if ladder. However, the syntax of the switch statement is cleaner and much easier to read and write.

# C++ Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reusable.

There are two types of function:

Standard Library Functions: Predefined in C++
User-defined Function: Created by users

## C++ Function Declaration

The syntax to declare a function is:

```C
returnType functionName (parameter1, parameter2,...) {
    // function body   
}
```

**Example of function declaration**

```C
// function declaration
void greet() {
    cout << "Hello World";
}
```

**Calling a Function**

In the above program, we have declared a function named greet(). To use the greet() function, we need to call it.

Here's how we can call the above greet() function.


```C

## C++ Function Type and Return Statement

![How function return works](./A/functions_return.png)


## C++ Function Prototype

In C++, the code of function declaration should be before the function call. However, if we want to define a function after the function call, we need to use the function prototype. For example,


```C
// function prototype
void add(int, int);

int main() {
    // calling the function before declaration.
    add(5, 3);
    return 0;
}

// function definition
void add(int a, int b) {
    cout << (a + b);
}
```

## C++ Function Overloading


In C++, two functions can have the same name if the number and/or type of arguments passed is different.
These functions having the same name but different arguments are known as overloaded functions. For example:

```C
// same name different arguments
int test() { }
int test(int a) { }
float test(double a) { }
int test(int a, double b) { }
```

## C++ Default Arguments

In C++ programming, we can provide default values for function parameters.

If a function with default arguments is called without passing arguments, then the default parameters are used.

However, if arguments are passed while calling the function, the default arguments are ignored.

```C
#include <iostream>

int add(int a=10, int b=20) {
    return (a + b);
}

int main() {
    int sum;

    std::cout << add() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

!!! WARNING
    Once we provide a default value for a parameter, all subsequent parameters must also have default values. For example,
    ```C
    // Invalid
    void add(int a, int b = 3, int c, int d);

    // Invalid
    void add(int a, int b = 3, int c, int d = 4);

    // Valid
    void add(int a, int c, int b = 3, int d = 4);
    ```

!!! WARNING
    If we are defining the default arguments in the function definition instead of the function prototype, then the function must be defined before the function call.
    ```C
    #include <iostream>

    int add(int a, int b);

    int main() {
        int sum;

        std::cout << add() << std::endl; // Invalid call
        
        std::cout << add(47, 54) << std::endl; // Valid call

        return 0;
    }

    int add(int a=10, int b=20) {
        return (a + b);
    }
    ```









# C++ Arrays, Strings and Math

In C++, an array is a variable that can store multiple values of the same type.

**General syntax of array declaration**
```C
Type arrayName[arraySize];
```
**Example**
```C
int numbers[10];
```

!!! WARNING
    In C++, the size and type of arrays cannot be changed after its declaration.


## Array Initialization
```C
// array declaration and initialization
int numbers[10] = {123,76,24,13,54,125,6,7,8,9};


// store only 3 elements in the array
// In such cases, the compiler assigns random values to the remaining places. Oftentimes, this random value is simply 0.
int numbers[10] = {0,1,2};


// array declaration and initialization with empty members
// In such cases, the compiler automatically computes the size.
int numbers[] = {0,1,2,3,4};
```

## Access Elements in C++ Array

```C
// syntax to access array elements
array[index];
```

!!! Note
    - The array indices start with 0. Meaning numbers[0] is the first element stored at index 0.

    - If the size of an array is n, the last element is stored at index (n-1). In this example, numbers[5] is the last element.

    - Elements of an array have consecutive addresses. For example, suppose the starting address of numbers[0] is 2120.

    - Then, the address of the next element numbers[1] will be 2124, the address of numbers[2] will be 2128, and so on.

    - Here, the size of each element is increased by 4. This is because the size of int is 4 bytes.



## Passing Arrays as Function Parameter/Argument

**General Syntax**
```C
returnType functionName(dataType arrayName[arraySize]) {
    // code
}
```

**Example**
```C
int average(int numbers[5]) {
    // code
}
```

**Function call with array**

When we call a function by passing an array as the argument, only the name of the array is used.
```C
int numbers[5] = {72,95,63,81,88};

average(numbers);
```

## String

```C
char str[]; // C style string is a regular array of chars that ends with non printable character '\0' or just number 0
char *str; // C style string. Same as char str[] 
string str; // C++ string
```

### String declaration and initialization
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
  char str1[] = {'H','e','l','l','o',' ','W','o','r','l','d','\0'}; // we have to manually add '\0' at the end of the char array and then it becomes as string
  char str2[] = "Hello World"; //compiler automatically adds '\0' for us
  string str3 = "Hello World";


  cout << str1 <<" | length : "<< sizeof(str1)/sizeof(char) << endl;
  cout << str2 <<" | length : "<< sizeof(str2)/sizeof(char) << endl;
  cout << str3 <<" | length : "<< str3.length() << endl;


  return 0;
}
```
Output
```sh
Hello World | length : 12
Hello World | length : 12
Hello World | length : 11
```

### Strings concatenation
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
  string str1 = "Hello";
  string str2 = "World";

  // In C++ the + operator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string. 
  // This is called concatenation. 
  // WARNING: concatenation with + operator is not available for C style strings.
  string str3 = str1 + " " + str2 + '!'; 


  cout << str3 << endl;


  return 0;
}
```

Output
```sh
Hello World!
```

**Example: geting strings from command line**

```C
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{

    string str_string = "";
    cout << "Enter words: ";
    getline(std::cin,str_string); // will get "unlimited" number of charcters


    char str_char[32];
    cout << "Enter words: ";
    std::cin.getline(str_char, 32); // will get maximum 32 characters 
    // std::cin.getline(str_char, 32); // will get maximum 32 characters or less, if there is a ,(comma) character
    // std::cin.get(str_char, 32, ',');


    cout << "Entered string is: " << str_string << endl;
    cout << "Entered char array is: " << str_char << endl;

    // !!! NOTE: 
    // getline() function works with C++ std::string objects.
    // cin.getline() and cin.get() work with "classic" C style strings

    return 0;
}
```
