# Ի՞նչ է `C++`-ը

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.


# Why Use C++

C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.











# C++ Get Started

To start using C++, you need two things:

A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand
There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).

## C++ Install IDE

1. https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2022-01-18/msys2-x86_64-20220118.exe
2. pacman -Syu
3. pacman -Su
4. pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
5. C:\msys64\mingw64\bin

## C++ quickstart

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

`TO RUN THE CODE` : Ctr+Shift+B -> select `C++ single file`

## Anatomy of our first C++ code

# C++ Comments
Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).
```C
// This is a comment
cout << "Hello World!";
```

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:
```C
cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`. Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler:
```C
/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
cout << "Hello World!";
```


# C++ Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false



Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

*`type variableName = value;`*

Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:
```C
//Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:
int myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;
```

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:
```C
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;
```

Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
```C
int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10
```

## Other Types

A demonstration of other data types:
```C
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)
```

## Display Variables

The cout object is used together with the << operator to display variables.

To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the << operator:
```C
int myAge = 35;
cout << "I am " << myAge << " years old.";
```

## Add Variables Together

To add a variable to another variable, you can use the + operator:
```C
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int sum = x + y;
cout << sum;
```
